# 🐍 Snake Game

Welcome to the **Snake Game**! This project is a modern rendition of the classic
snake game, built using **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind
CSS**. It also leverages **Heroicons** for beautiful icons and **Axios** for
seamless API calls. The game is designed to be smooth and responsive, providing
an engaging experience for players.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Snake Movement**: The snake moves smoothly across the board,
  changing direction based on arrow key inputs.
- **Food Generation**: Different types of food (small, medium, large) appear
  randomly on the board, each providing different points.
- **Speed Increase**: As your score increases, the snake's speed also increases,
  adding to the challenge.
- **Pause and Resume**: You can pause and resume the game using the spacebar.
- **High Scores**: Your scores are stored and displayed, allowing you to compete
  with yourself.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Vite**: Fast and optimized frontend build tool.
- **React**: For building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Typed JavaScript for safer and more robust code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Heroicons**: Beautiful, free SVG icons.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- **Zod**: TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
